Experiment No. 1
Aim:
To install and set up Visual Studio Code and MinGW-w64 for C++ programming, and to implement:

A simple "Hello World" program.

A basic calculator program in C++.

Tools Required:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)


Theory:
In this experiment, you learn to set up a basic C++ programming environment using Visual Studio Code and MinGW-w64.

The Hello World program is a simple starting point that demonstrates the basic syntax of a C++ program including:

Preprocessor directives

main() function

Output using cout

The Calculator Program demonstrates:

Taking input using cin

Performing basic arithmetic operations (like addition)

Displaying results using cout

Use of operators and conditional statements (if extended)

Key C++ Concepts:

#include<iostream>: Includes the standard I/O stream.

using namespace std;: Avoids using std:: repeatedly.

int main(): Entry point of the program.

cout, cin: Output and input streams respectively.

Conclusion:
By performing this experiment:

You have successfully set up a C++ development environment on your system.

You have understood and implemented the structure of a basic C++ program.

You have learned how to write and execute simple programs including output and user input handling using VS Code.
